# The war is in its peak, but you, young Padawan, can turn the tides with your programming skills.
# You are tasked to create a program to decrypt the messages of The Order and prevent the death of hundreds of lives.
# You will receive several messages, which are encrypted using the legendary star enigma.
# You should decrypt the messages, following these rules:
# To properly decrypt a message, you should count all the letters [s, t, a, r]
# â€“ case insensitive and remove the count from the current ASCII value of each symbol of the encrypted message.
# After decryption:
# Each message should have a planet name, population,
# attack type ('A', as attack or 'D', as destruction) and soldier count.
# The planet name starts after '@' and contains only letters from the Latin alphabet.
# The planet population starts after ':' and is an Integer;
# The attack type may be "A"(attack) or "D"(destruction) and must be surrounded by "!" (exclamation mark).
# The soldier count starts after "->" and should be an Integer.
# The order in the message should be: planet name -> planet population -> attack type -> soldier count.
# Each part can be separated from the others by any character except: '@', '-', '!', ':' and '>'.
