# Write a program that evaluates a string expression.
# Write a program that evaluates a string expression. You will be given that string expression on the first line in the
# form of numbers and operators separated with a single space from each other.
# Your job is to take that string expression and calculate the result after evaluating it.
# To do that, you have to follow a simple rule. If, for example,
# we have this string "2 4 * 1 3 -", the first time we meet an operator (*), we should take all the numbers we have so
# far (2, 4), apply that operation to them, and save the result (8). The next time we meet an operator (-),
# we again take all the numbers we have (8, 1, 3) and apply the operator to them in that order (8 - 1 - 3 = 4).
# In the end, we print the result.
# All the numbers will always be integers, and the possible operators are "*", "+", "-", "/".
# It is important to keep the order of the numbers (especially for "/" and "-" because the order matters).
# When having a division, you should round the result to the lower integer.
# Input
# â€¢	Single line: a string containing integers and operators
# Output
# â€¢	Single number: the result after the evaluation
