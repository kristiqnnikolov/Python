# Everything in the Satna Claus' workshop was going well until, on one freezing Sunday,
# a dangerous storm destroyed almost all toys. Now Santa's elves fear they won't be able to meet their December deadline
#  It could be a disaster, and some children around the world may not get their Christmas toys.
#  Luckily, you've come up with an idea, and you just need to write a program that manages your plan.
# The Christmas elves have special toy-making skills - еach elf can make a toy from a given number of materials.
# First, you will receive a sequence of integers representing each elf's energy.
# On the following line, you will be given another sequence of integers,
# each representing a number of materials in a box.
# Your task is to calculate the total elves' energy used for making toys and the total number of successfully made toys.
# You are very clever and have immediately recognized the pros and cons of the work process -
# the first elf takes the last box of materials and tries to create the toy:
# •	Usually, the elf needs energy equal to the number of materials.
# If he has enough energy, he makes the toy. His energy decreases by the used energy,
# and the toy goes straight to Santa's bag. Then, the elf eats a cookie reward which increases his energy by 1,
# and goes to the end of the line, preparing for the upcoming boxes.
# •	Every third time one of the elves takes a box, he tries his best to be creative,
# and he will need twice as much energy as usual. If he has enough, he manages to create 2 toys.
# Then, his energy decreases; he eats a cookie reward and goes to the end of the line, similar to the first bullet.
# •	Every fifth time one of the elves takes a box, he is a little clumsy and somehow manages to
# break the toy when he just made it (if he made it). The toy is thrown away, and the elf doesn't get a cookie reward.
# However, his energy is already spent, and it needs to be added to the total elves' energy.
# o	If an elf creates 2 toys, but he is clumsy, he breaks them.
# •	If an elf does not have enough energy, he leaves the box of materials to the next elf.
# Instead of making the toy, the elf drinks a hot chocolate which doubles his energy, and goes to the end of the line,
# preparing for the upcoming boxes.
# Note: North Pole's social policy is very tolerant of the elves. If the current elf's energy is less than 5 units,
# he does NOT TAKE a box, but he takes a day off. Remove the elf from the collection.
# Stop crafting toys when you are out of materials or elves.
# Input
# •	The first line of input will represent each elf's energy - integers, separated by a single space
# •	On the second line, you will be given the number of materials in each box - integers, separated by a single space
# Output
# •	On the first line, print the number of created toys: "Toys: {total_number_of_toys}"
# •	On the second line, print the total used energy: "Energy: {total_used_energy}"
# •	On the next two lines print the elves and boxes that are left, if there are any, otherwise skip the line:
# o	"Elves left: {elf1}, {elf2}, … {elfN}"
# o	"Boxes left: {box1}, {box2}, … {boxN}"
