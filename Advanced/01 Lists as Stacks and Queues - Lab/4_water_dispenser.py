# Write a program which keeps track of people who are getting water from a dispenser and
# the amount of water left at the end.
# On the first line you will receive the starting quantity of water (integer) in a dispenser.
# Then, on the next few lines you will be given the names of some people who want to get water (each on separate line)
# until you receive the command "Start". Add those people in a queue.
# Finally, you will receive some commands until the command "End":
# -	"{liters}" - litters (integer) that the current person in the queue wants to get.
# Check if there is enough water in the dispenser for that person.
# o	If there is enough water, print "{person_name} got water" and remove him/her from the queue.
# o	Otherwise, print "{person_name} must wait" and remove the person
# from the queue without reducing the water in the dispenser.
# -	"refill {liters}" - add the given litters in the dispenser.
# At the end print how many litters of water have left in the format: "{left_liters} liters left".
