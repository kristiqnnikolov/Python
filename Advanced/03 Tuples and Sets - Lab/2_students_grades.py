# On the following N lines, you will be receiving a student's name and their grade.
# For each student print all his/her grades and finally his/her average grade,
# formatted to the second decimal point in the format:
# "{student's name} -> {grade1} {grade2} ... {gradeN} (avg: {average_grade})".
# The order in which we print the result does not matter.
